<p>I am a graduate student in Software Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University - School of Computer Science (Institute for Software Research).
Previously, I was a Senior Software Engineer at Myntra Designs, one of India's leading fashion ecommerce companies.</p>

<p>My current interests at grad school are the design, architecture, and management of large-scale software systems, along with Machine Learning.</p>

<h3>Course Descriptions</h3>

<h4>17651 - Models of Software Systems</h4>
<ul class="skill-list">
	<li><strong>Overview:</strong> This course is concerned with formally modeling software systems, such as the standard models for representing sequential and concurrent systems, such as state machines, algebras and traces. It shows how you can use different logics to specify properties of software systems, such as functional correctness, deadlock freedom, and internal consistency. Concepts such as composition mechanisms, abstraction relations, invariants, non-determinism, and inductive and denotational descriptions are recurrent themes throughout the course.<br/>
	</li>
	<li><b>Topics Covered:</b> Logic, State Machines and Reasoning, <a href="https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/ltsa/">Labelled Transition System Analyser (LTSA)</a>, Relational models with <a href="http://alloy.lcs.mit.edu/alloy/">Alloy</a>, Concurrent Systems with Linear Temporal Logic, Probabilistic Modelling with <a href="https://www.prismmodelchecker.org/">PRISM</a>.
	</li>
</ul>

<h4>17652 - Methods - Deciding what to design</h4>
<ul class="skill-list">
	<li>Overview: Practical development of software requires an understanding of successful methods for bridging the gap between a problem to be solved and a working software system. In this course, we studied a variety of ways to understand the problem that we're solving, the various factors that constrain the possible solutions, and approaches to deciding among alternatives. A few topics include: Requirements Engineering, Interviews/Surveys/Focus Groups, Goal Modeling, Use-case Analysis, User-centered design, Prototypes and Mockups.
	</li>
</ul>

<h4>17653 - Managing Software Development</h4>
<ul class="skill-list">
	<li>Overview: Large scale software development requires the ability to manage resources — both human and computational — through control of the development process. This course is a breadth oriented course, designed to help technically-trained software engineers to acquire the knowledge and skills necessary to lead a project team, understand the relationship of software development to overall project engineering, estimate time and costs, and understand the software process.
	</li>
</ul>

<h4>15513 - Intro to Computer Systems</h4>
<ul class="skill-list">
	<li><a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~213/">Course Page</a>
	</li>
	<li>This course provides a programmer's view of how computer systems execute programs, store information, and communicate. It enables students to become more effective programmers, especially in dealing with issues of performance, portability and robustness. It also serves as a foundation for courses on compilers, networks, operating systems, and computer architecture, where a deeper understanding of systems-level issues is required. Topics covered include: machine-level code and its generation by optimizing compilers, performance evaluation and optimization, computer arithmetic, memory organization and management, networking technology and protocols, and supporting concurrent computation.
	</li>
	<li> Assignments:
	<ul>
		<li> C Programming Lab
		<li> Data lab - working with low-level C code - bit manipulation.
		<li> Bomb lab - defuse a bomb by reverse-engineering x86-64 assembly code.
		<li> Attack lab - generate exploits by manipulating the heap by injecting x86-64 assembly code.
		<li> Cache lab - design and implement a memory cache.
		<li> Malloc lab - design and implement your own malloc library.
		<li> TSH lab - design and implement a unix shell process, handling concurrency, threads, signals, and exceptions.
		<li> Proxy lab - design and implement a proxy server in C handling concurrency, and threads with reasonable performance.
